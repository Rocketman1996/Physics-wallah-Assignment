For example, you can calculate the mode for nominal data, but you cannot calculate the mean because there is no meaningful average. If you incorrectly analyze data at a higher level of measurement, you may draw incorrect conclusions. For instance, calculating the mean age (ratio) for a group of people when you only have ordinal data for their age groups (e.g., young, middle-aged, elderly) would be misleading."
